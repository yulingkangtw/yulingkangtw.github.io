<p>New York city is a busy and dense modern city. There are always buses, taxis and underground trains commuting and moving people around the city. Millions of people are scattered amongst the maze-like streets, talking on their mobile phones, playing loud music, meeting for coffee, having arguments - simply doing the things that city folk like to do.</p>
<p>Amongst all this madness, on the top level of a skyscraper apartment, looking out at the city from his balcony, is a medium-sized pure white box. His name is Bob.</p>
<p>Bob is a paper box, so he is vulnerable to water damage. Anything from an ordinary shower to a light drizzle of rain, even to walking on a wet floor, can damage Bob’s paper. If he touches water, he gets mushy and saggy.</p>
<p>This has happened to him before. Once, he suddenly found himself caught in a heavy rainstorm. He had no time to make it to shelter, so he took cover under a public seat. He waited there for several hours until the rain stopped. Bob had some water damage, but he was able to dry himself using the sun’s warmth.</p>
<p>It is a typical Sunday night, just after 10pm, on a warm summer night. New York city’s nightlife has only just begun. Bob is looking out at the city with disgust and annoyance. Inside his head, he is swearing at the city, cursing its constant noise. He can’t get any peace in this city.</p>
<p>Bob makes himself comfortable on the balcony, momentarily accepting the noise, and pulls out his collection of little shiny metal things.</p>
<p>Collecting these found objects is Bob’s greatest passion. He loves these little things, like bottle caps, coins, screws, keys, paperclips – anything that is metal and shiny.</p>
<p>Bob partly loves them because he uses them to entertain at parties. He pulls out his collection, places them in a row, and hits them. He makes beautiful and fun music with these objects. He can always make some interesting melodies. Also at parties, Bob places them around the room to reflect the party lights. This creates a wonderful dance of reflections.</p>
<p>Another reason why Bob loves collecting little shiny metal things is that he feels more special with his collection. Bob is a simple white box with no special images, text or features. Because of this, he rarely gets the attention he wants. Having a collection helps Bob feel special.</p>
<p>Bob’s collection is getting bigger and bigger every day as he finds more and more objects. However, Bob knows that he can’t keep everything he finds. If he did, he would be so heavy and full all the time. So, Bob has to sell his objects. This isn’t so bad, because it earns him some money. But Bob loves his objects, so he would much prefer to keep them.</p>
<p>Because of this, Bob walks around the streets with a little bit of fear. He is afraid that he will find something so amazing that he will be forced to give up one of his treasures. These decisions are very hard for Bob because he is so passionate about his found objects. When he finds something new, he is forced to prioritize and this is very stressful for Bob. If Bob had things his way, he would keep all the little shiny metal things.</p>
<p>There is a warm wind on the balcony. Bob is admiring his collection and trying not to focus on the noise. But then a loud car beeps its horn and two people start having an argument.</p>
<p>That’s enough. Bob feels so annoyed. All he wants is some peace and quiet. He picks up his collection and goes inside the apartment. He closes all the doors and windows and sets up his collection in the living room.</p>
<p>Bob manages to get a few moments of quiet as he admires a mysterious shiny coin. Unfortunately, a garbage truck stops nearby and makes a horrible noise!</p>
<p><strong><em>“It’s no use! I give up! I need to get out of this place,”</em></strong></p>
<p>says Bob quietly in frustration.</p>
<p>Bob wants to escape his pain, so he decides to visit his friend and have a party. This will take his mind off of this noise.</p>
<p>Bob’s friend owns a second-hand shop. They became friends because Bob frequently went to that shop to sell his little shiny metal things – the one’s he couldn’t keep anymore. After so many visits, they started talking and discovered they both loved partying.</p>
<p>Bob leaves the house in a hurry and quickly makes his way to the second-hand shop.
Bob is feeling annoyed and frustrated. He doesn’t look at anyone on the street. He is hoping that he doesn’t encounter anyone he knows. But then, in the distance, he sees his neighbours. They live in the apartment right next to his. Bob panics and hides. Luckily they didn’t see him.</p>
<p>Even though Bob is always nice to these neighbours, he doesn’t like them. They always end up having the same conversation, over and over again. Somehow the conversation is always about their kids, their kid’s exams or just how intelligent their kids are. Bob is always so bored.</p>
<p>Bob must go down this street. This will mean that he must go passed them. Bob calms down and remembers what he must do.</p>
<p>No one knows that Bob can actually transform shape. He doesn’t tell anyone because he uses this ability for situations like this. Bob loves his peace and quiet so much that sometimes he doesn’t want anyone to recognise him.</p>
<p>Bob transforms shape and becomes a white figure. He looks a lot like a human, with arms, legs and a human body.</p>
<p>Bob calmly and confidently walks straight passed his neighbours. They are clueless. They don’t notice it’s Bob.</p>
<p>After he gets away from them, Bob transforms back into his usual self, the medium-sized white box.</p>
<p>Arriving at the shop and greeting his friend, Bob pulls out his collection of little shiny metal things.</p>
<p>Bob says with excitement</p>
<p><strong><em>“I’m here with my awesome collection! Let’s forget about all the madness of this city and party!”</em></strong></p>
<p>His friend says</p>
<p><strong><em>“Thank you! I’ve been desperate for some fun all day. I’ll close up early.”</em></strong></p>
<p>His friend walks to the door and flips the sign. It reads Closed.</p>
<p>Bob and his friend set up Bob’s collection around the room and create a little performance space. They turn on the special lights and see hundreds of reflections. Then they start playing some music using the metal objects.</p>
<p>They have so much fun that they don’t realise it has started raining.</p>
<p>Once they stop, Bob looks out the window and says</p>
<p><strong><em>“Oh no… It looks like I will have to stay here tonight.”</em></strong></p>
