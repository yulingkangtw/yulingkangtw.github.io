[{"categories":["Story"],"contents":"The Box’s Secret yuling \u0026amp; Teacher Jesse Audio by Jesse New York city is a busy and dense modern city. There are always buses, taxis and underground trains commuting and moving people around the city. Millions of people are scattered amongst the maze-like streets, talking on their mobile phones, playing loud music, meeting for coffee, having arguments - simply doing the things that city folk like to do.\nAmongst all this madness, on the top level of a skyscraper apartment, looking out at the city from his balcony, is a medium-sized pure white box. His name is Bob.\nBob is a paper box, so he is vulnerable to water damage. Anything from an ordinary shower to a light drizzle of rain, even to walking on a wet floor, can damage Bob’s paper. If he touches water, he gets mushy and saggy.\nThis has happened to him before. Once, he suddenly found himself caught in a heavy rainstorm. He had no time to make it to shelter, so he took cover under a public seat. He waited there for several hours until the rain stopped. Bob had some water damage, but he was able to dry himself using the sun’s warmth.\nIt is a typical Sunday night, just after 10pm, on a warm summer night. New York city’s nightlife has only just begun. Bob is looking out at the city with disgust and annoyance. Inside his head, he is swearing at the city, cursing its constant noise. He can’t get any peace in this city.\nBob makes himself comfortable on the balcony, momentarily accepting the noise, and pulls out his collection of little shiny metal things.\nCollecting these found objects is Bob’s greatest passion. He loves these little things, like bottle caps, coins, screws, keys, paperclips – anything that is metal and shiny.\nBob partly loves them because he uses them to entertain at parties. He pulls out his collection, places them in a row, and hits them. He makes beautiful and fun music with these objects. He can always make some interesting melodies. Also at parties, Bob places them around the room to reflect the party lights. This creates a wonderful dance of reflections.\nAnother reason why Bob loves collecting little shiny metal things is that he feels more special with his collection. Bob is a simple white box with no special images, text or features. Because of this, he rarely gets the attention he wants. Having a collection helps Bob feel special.\nBob’s collection is getting bigger and bigger every day as he finds more and more objects. However, Bob knows that he can’t keep everything he finds. If he did, he would be so heavy and full all the time. So, Bob has to sell his objects. This isn’t so bad, because it earns him some money. But Bob loves his objects, so he would much prefer to keep them.\nBecause of this, Bob walks around the streets with a little bit of fear. He is afraid that he will find something so amazing that he will be forced to give up one of his treasures. These decisions are very hard for Bob because he is so passionate about his found objects. When he finds something new, he is forced to prioritize and this is very stressful for Bob. If Bob had things his way, he would keep all the little shiny metal things.\nThere is a warm wind on the balcony. Bob is admiring his collection and trying not to focus on the noise. But then a loud car beeps its horn and two people start having an argument.\nThat’s enough. Bob feels so annoyed. All he wants is some peace and quiet. He picks up his collection and goes inside the apartment. He closes all the doors and windows and sets up his collection in the living room.\nBob manages to get a few moments of quiet as he admires a mysterious shiny coin. Unfortunately, a garbage truck stops nearby and makes a horrible noise!\n“It’s no use! I give up! I need to get out of this place,”\nsays Bob quietly in frustration.\nBob wants to escape his pain, so he decides to visit his friend and have a party. This will take his mind off of this noise.\nBob’s friend owns a second-hand shop. They became friends because Bob frequently went to that shop to sell his little shiny metal things – the one’s he couldn’t keep anymore. After so many visits, they started talking and discovered they both loved partying.\nBob leaves the house in a hurry and quickly makes his way to the second-hand shop. Bob is feeling annoyed and frustrated. He doesn’t look at anyone on the street. He is hoping that he doesn’t encounter anyone he knows. But then, in the distance, he sees his neighbours. They live in the apartment right next to his. Bob panics and hides. Luckily they didn’t see him.\nEven though Bob is always nice to these neighbours, he doesn’t like them. They always end up having the same conversation, over and over again. Somehow the conversation is always about their kids, their kid’s exams or just how intelligent their kids are. Bob is always so bored.\nBob must go down this street. This will mean that he must go passed them. Bob calms down and remembers what he must do.\nNo one knows that Bob can actually transform shape. He doesn’t tell anyone because he uses this ability for situations like this. Bob loves his peace and quiet so much that sometimes he doesn’t want anyone to recognise him.\nBob transforms shape and becomes a white figure. He looks a lot like a human, with arms, legs and a human body.\nBob calmly and confidently walks straight passed his neighbours. They are clueless. They don’t notice it’s Bob.\nAfter he gets away from them, Bob transforms back into his usual self, the medium-sized white box.\nArriving at the shop and greeting his friend, Bob pulls out his collection of little shiny metal things.\nBob says with excitement\n“I’m here with my awesome collection! Let’s forget about all the madness of this city and party!”\nHis friend says\n“Thank you! I’ve been desperate for some fun all day. I’ll close up early.”\nHis friend walks to the door and flips the sign. It reads Closed.\nBob and his friend set up Bob’s collection around the room and create a little performance space. They turn on the special lights and see hundreds of reflections. Then they start playing some music using the metal objects.\nThey have so much fun that they don’t realise it has started raining.\nOnce they stop, Bob looks out the window and says\n“Oh no… It looks like I will have to stay here tonight.”\nVocabulary   List item:\n This is a blockquote example.\n   List item:\n This is a blockquote example.\n   List item:\n This is a blockquote example.\n   List item:\n This is a blockquote example.\n   List item:\n This is a blockquote example.\n   Link Create a story with Jesse\n","permalink":"https://yulingkangtw.github.io/blog/post-2/","tags":["Object"],"title":"The Box’s Secret"},{"categories":["Story"],"contents":"The Giant Red Panda yuling \u0026amp; Teacher Jesse Audio by Jesse   It is 9pm on a Monday on a very hot August night. Everyone in Tokyo is very excited tonight because the Olympic games are happening.\nRight outside of the Olympic stadium is a night food market selling noodles, sushi and all kinds of Japanese and western foods. In the middle of the market, happily stuffing his face with various foods, is a giant Red Panda named David. He has recently come out of the stadium and into the market to try all sorts of traditional foods.\nDavid is a professional athlete and earlier tonight won a gold medal in a swimming event. Because David is a giant Red Panda, all he needed to do was dive into the pool at one end and then get out instantly at the other. David was the same size as the Olympic-sized swimming pool. Needless to say, he always wins his swimming events.\nUsually David spends his time training, averaging about 10 hours every day. However, because the Olympics has started, he is able to get some rest and relaxation after his events.\nDavid was spotted by a swimming coach when he was around four years old. The coach noticed how large David was and suggested to David’s parents that he become a professional athlete. It was clear how successful David would become because he grew so quickly and became the tallest athlete within a few years.\nSmelling all of the amazing foods, David’s mouth is watering as he buys every dish he can see. He is holding several dishes in each hand, trying to balance them as he takes a bite off each plate. David is a giant, so, naturally, he can eat a lot of food. David has yet to eat ice-cream, which he is very excited about, especially the candy-floss rainbow bubble-gum ice-cream!\nEven though David is a huge, strong, intimidating athlete, he secretly has the heart of an innocent and playful child. When he’s not training, you can find David playing with his cotton dolls, reading delightful picture books, watching child-like cartoons or singing emotional Disney songs. David doesn’t tell people about his secret hobbies because he thinks they will make fun of him and call him strange. So, he does these things in private, keeping his joy to himself.\nDavid has promised himself that he will eat as much food at the market as possible until 12pm, but then he needs to retire back to his hotel and get some sleep. David is well-loved and welcome at the market. The market-goers and stall owners look at him like he is a star. They are so impressed by his gold medals and his incredible size!\nSurrounding David are ten other athletes from tonight’s event. They are regular-sized people but look tiny in comparison to David. David is paying for their food because he won the most gold medals tonight. Tonight’s celebration is on him.\nBecause David is enjoying the sights, smells and tastes so much, he hasn’t realised that there is a huge line of people behind him. They can’t get passed David because he takes up so much room. These people are feeling frustrated, tired and hungry. They want to get to their favourite food!\nA kid in the line behind David starts crying, saying\n“Mommy, I’m so hungry! Who is that huge animal? Why does he stop us from eating?”\nDavid overhears this cry and turns around to see the child. David feels sorry for the boy’s hunger and embarrassed about his own size.\nDavid is reminded of when he was a little child and he got stuck in a small building. He felt trapped and afraid. It was very dramatic because lots of firefighters came to the building. They had to pull him out, destroying the door and walls to get to him. Ever since then, David has been afraid of getting stuck.\nDavid swallows his fear, lifts up the child and tries to comfort him. David says “Hush now, little boy. Don’t be sad. No one here is trapped. I will fix things and get you your food.” David puts down the boy and takes a big inward breath. He sucks in his stomach as much as he can. A few people are able to squeeze past, but, eventually, David runs out of oxygen and has to let out his breath. Once again, people are stuck behind David.\nDavid has another idea and announces,\n“Follow me, everyone! Let’s make a food train! I will buy the food and share it with you. After you have eaten some food, pass it to the person behind you. Then we will move onto the next stall and repeat it. Buy, share. Buy, share. Okay?”\nThey try this idea, moving along as a food train. It works for a while, but then from the back of the line someone yells,\n“Hey, Red Panda! We’re not getting any food! This isn’t working!”\nDavid stops moving and says\n“Okay, listen up, everyone! I’m going to buy all of the food in the market!”\nEveryone in the crowd gasps. They are shocked and some are even angry.\n“Wait, wait, wait. I’m going to buy the food and then everyone can come back to my hotel. There’s enough space there for everyone! We can all have a party!”\nEveryone in the market cheers and laughs! David goes first up to his hotel, carrying as much food as he can. Everyone helps out and carries their own dish. The whole market, including the chefs and waiters, go up to David’s hotel.\nEveryone spends the rest of the night there eating, laughing and dancing.\nIt was a great party.\nVocabulary   List item:\n This is a blockquote example.\n   List item:\n This is a blockquote example.\n   List item:\n This is a blockquote example.\n   List item:\n This is a blockquote example.\n   List item:\n This is a blockquote example.\n   Link Create a story with Jesse\n","permalink":"https://yulingkangtw.github.io/blog/post-1/","tags":["Animal"],"title":"The Giant Red Panda"},{"categories":["Go Language"],"contents":"Heading 1 Heading 2 Heading 3 Heading 4 Heading 5 Heading 6 Emphasis Emphasis, aka italics, with asterisks or underscores.\nStrong emphasis, aka bold, with asterisks or underscores.\nCombined emphasis with asterisks and underscores.\nStrikethrough uses two tildes.
