[{"categories":["Story"],"contents":"The Cookie Shop by yuling \u0026amp; Teacher Jesse  Audio by Jesse    Amongst a huge and expansive busy metropolitan city, in a quiet little lane, tucked away behind large skyscrapers, is a tiny little cookie shop. This shop is run by a tiny little T-Rex dinosaur, who wears a tiny little suit, has tiny little teeth and tiny little claws, and serves tiny little cookies. This dinosaur’s name is Terry.\nTerry loves selling cookies. It has been his life-long passion. Every morning he opens his tiny little shop with a big smile and a breath of fresh air. He is a one-man business, doing everything from the opening and closing, to the cleaning, to taking orders, to managing the finances, to dealing with the customers, to preparing the advertising - everything!\nHe even cooks his own cookies, making strange combinations of flavours. He sees his kitchen as a laboratory and himself as a scientist, doing experiments with flavours. However, the majority of his cookies stock comes from other retailers.\nTerry buys cookies online and brings them into his shop to sell. He searches for the most exotic flavours from all across the globe. One of his most recent imports was the notorious ant-flavoured cookie. It sold well during its first few months and when sales started to drop, Terry swapped it for another.\nTerry continuously stocks his best-selling cookie. It’s called the Summer Fruit Cookie. He doesn’t publicly advertise this, but it’s actually his own creation. He grows all the fruit used in the cookie in his backyard.\nTerry absolutely adores his backyard. It’s his sanctuary, his place where he retreats from the world and is able to be in peace. Even though Terry is a tiny T-Rex, his backyard is huge even for regular human beings. He has grown all kinds of varieties of plants, including fruits and vegetables. He has ten different species of banana, some of which are not even edible, but he collects them none the less.\nTerry’s garden is known across the city for its wide variety of fruits and vegetables. Terry started his garden after a life-changing experience with a new kind of food.\nTerry used to be like a normal T-Rex, eating meat and drinking blood, but one evening he was introduced to a vegetable cookie, something he had never eaten ever in his life. It was love at first taste. That cabbage and carrot cookie radically shifted his palate and set him on a path towards vegetarianism. Now Terry is a proud vegetarian and shares his values with his city.\nTerry wants to grow his garden and expand the reach of his message. However, his cookie shop hasn’t been generating enough profit to accommodate this expansion. He needs to bring in more money. He needs more customers. He needs to try something new, exciting, different and courageous.\nBut when Terry is thinking up new plans, fear arises in his mind. A voice tells him that taking a chance will cause him to lose money and losing money will be the end of his business and then his garden! Then it tells him that if he tries something new, customers will leave him and seek out other snack shops, like cake shops or candy shops or muffin shops. This fear has paralysed Terry and kept him back.\nToday is a sunny afternoon and Terry is spending time in his garden, watering plants and weeding out others. A tiny little bird has perched on Terry’s fence and is keeping him company. Terry is focused on gardening while his mind spins around coming up with ways he can grow his business. The bird tweets at him. Terry looks in confusion. What did it just say? It tweets again. Ice-cream? Did it really just say ice-cream? Ice-cream! Yes!\nTerry runs inside, straight to his kitchen, grabs the ice-cream out of the freezer and slams it on the counter. An ice-cream cookie, that’s it! He mixes the ice-cream into his cookie dough and puts it into the oven. Time passes as Terry waits with a slight feeling of anxiety. Time’s up. He takes out the cookies and finds that they are all soggy and wet. Oh no, this won’t do. Customers will never eat this. It’s more like a dog’s breakfast than a boutique cookie. Back to the drawing board.\nLater in the night, Terry is out for an evening stroll around the city. Being a tiny T-Rex, Terry is very close to the ground and so he is in close contact to all the smells of the city. Hmm. Another idea strikes. How about something strange and slightly gross, just like this city? Maybe people will be charmed by the ugliness.\nTerry looks online and finds some obscure bottles of flavours, such as hot garbage, stinky sock, charcoal BBQ, damp mould and rotting strawberry. He purchases them instantly.\nThey arrive the next day, Terry combines them to his popular cookie dough and awaits the results. Surprisingly, not bad. He puts them in his tiny shop window the next day.\nAt first, customers are attracted to the new flavours.\n**“How strange, hot garbage?”**they say as they pass by the window.\nBusy is good for a few days, but then sales dwindle. While they are exciting and new, people aren’t buying more than one. No one is coming back for seconds.\nFeeling defeated, Terry sits back in his tiny little chair in his tiny little shop. Then his tiny little computer receives a message.\nBuy now! New exciting products! All styles! All brands! Cheap! Cheap! Cheap! It’s a picture of a shiny new chair. Terry is intrigued. Maybe online advertising, maybe that is the missing ingredient.\nHe navigates online to an advertising agency and purchases an ad bundle. The website is asking for pictures, so he snaps a few shots with his camera and uploads them. Hmm, that was fast and simple. I wonder if the results will be any good? The website tells him to wait and that he will receive his ads in 72 hours.\nAwaking one morning, Terry checks his email. They have arrived. Oh my, what is that? His cookies don’t look special at all. They look nothing like the shiny new chair. What happened? They look ordinary and average. At the bottom of the website, it reads: No Refunds. Terry sees no increase in customers.\nTerry is out of ideas. He has tried everything and he is exhausted. He opens his shop like normal, this time struggling to put on a smile. He goes inside and takes a deep breath. He starts doing yoga and connecting with the inner stillness and peace. Then it hits him. Ice-cream… But not like before. Before wasn’t right. Mixing the ingredients together doesn’t bring out the unique magic of each. Each flavour needs to stand alone and be proud of its essence.\nTerry yells in excitement “Inside the cookie!”\nHe closes up shop and runs back home to his kitchen. He bakes a regular batch of cookies, and when they are finished, he carefully injects some vanilla ice-cream into the centre. Fantastic! Delicious! Wonderful! This is it! Next he experiments with ice-cream and fresh fruits. Even better!\nHe throws together a few quick ice-cream cookies and rushes back to the shop. He puts them into the front widow and waits. Customers start coming in. Word starts to spread across the city that there has been an innovation in cookie technology. Terry’s Cookie Shop has taken off.\nWith his new success, Terry is able to expand his garden and plant more and more fruits and vegetables. His garden has become more like a farm. Terry begins to work the land just like he did before; however, now, Terry is joined, not by one bird, but by dozens.\n Link Create stories with the teacher Jesse\n","permalink":"https://yulingkangtw.github.io/blog/post-9/","tags":["Animal"],"title":"The Cookie Shop"},{"categories":["Story"],"contents":"Thunder Penguin – Part 2 by yuling \u0026amp; Teacher Jesse  Audio by Jesse    “Okay, Thunder, we’ve given you everything we’ve got,” said one of the puffer fish.\n“We’ve set you obstacles and chased you around this huge ocean enough already. If there’s any more improvement you can make, it won’t be with us. We’ve done all we can do,” said the puffer fish.\nThat was several days ago. Since then, Thunder has been carefully watching the surface of the ocean, waiting to see the shadow pass by.\nWith his eyes locked on the surface, Thunder continues life as normal, catching fish, training other sea creatures and writing notes into his notebook.\nThen, it happens. A large, ominous and dark shadow drifts across the surface. The ocean current changes from a gentle sway to a forceful push. Schools of fish scatter and hide. Thunder sees this happening up ahead, far in the distance. His eyes open wide and his heart starts pounding. This is it. This is his chance.\nHe sets off with lightning speed and chases the shadow. Woah, Thunder has made incredible improvements. He is so fast now, so agile, so swift, in the water. He is quickly approaching the shadow when something emerges from nowhere and grabs Thunder.\nHe is pulled down and away from the shadow. Thunder sees it drift further into the distance. Thunder turns to the creature which grabbed him.\n“Hey, what’s the big idea? What do you think you’re doing? I was chasing that shadow,” says Thunder.\nTo his surprise, the creature that grabbed him is actually three: a sea horse, jelly fish and a whale. They were acting like a chain with the whale providing all the force and power.\nThe jelly fish speaks first.\n“Thunder, we’ve heard about what you’re planning to do. We had to stop you.”\n“Stop me? What are you talking about? Everyone around here is so scared of that thing, but I’m going to discover what it is”\nThe jelly fish continues\n“We couldn’t just sit by and let you be taken.”\n“Taken?” says Thunder.\nThe sea horse now speaks.\n“Yes, taken. We’ve seen its power. We’ve seen it take our friends and family.”\nThe jelly fish interrupts with panic,\n“Not just our friends and family, but any sea creature! Any creature that has approached the monstrous shadow has never been seen again.”\nThunder says while unable to keep still\n“That’s just fear talking. My curiosity is positive and will guide me and protect me. I’m an adventure-seeking creature. It’s in my blood. I will uncover this mystery. Plus, maybe those sea creatures disappeared some other way.”\nNow the whale speaks up.\n“Thunder, these stories are no joke. Creatures have disappeared. The monstrous shadow is real. I have seen its mighty lights, as blinding as the sun.”\nThe jelly fish says\n“And I have heard its evil cry, even though I saw no sign of it. Its metallic voice is horrible and deep.”\nThe sea horse says\n“And I have seen the worst of all. I have seen its gigantic tongue, which sweeps across the ocean and collects anything in its path. It rips everything out of the ocean and leaves nothing behind.”\nThe whale continues\n“These are all true, Thunder. This monster will devour you. We had to warn you to stay away.”\nThunder replies\n“Really? That sounds like some kind of scary story. No one has ever identified a sea creature like the one you’re describing. If someone had, I would know about it.”\nThunder has a sense of fear moving through his body. However, he won’t acknowledge it. His desire for discovery and adventure is clouding his judgement. Thunder will continue and seek out the monster.\nHowever, the monster has sought them out first.\nA few seconds after Thunder finishes speaking, the shadowy monster suddenly appears. Its tongue reaches deep down into the waters and moves suddenly towards them. Its tongue is wide and long and moves quickly. The whale, with its protective quality, swims straight towards it. It slams straight into the tongue and the tongue retracts back up to the surface.\nThunder, seeing that the whale has sacrificed itself for the others, feels a strong compulsion to help. Thunder darts quickly towards the tongue and grabs on, being pulled up to the surface as well.\nThe tongue emerges out of the water and drops both the whale and Thunder straight into the centre of a large ship.\nThunder hits the ground hard, landing on top of dozens of species of fish, all of different shapes and sizes.\n“Oh boy, look at that whale! Finally, something valuable! Not like all these little worthless critters,”\nsays a voice from far off on the ship.\nThunder looks around and inspects the ship. He has never seen anything like this. What he thought was a tongue looks like something used to catch fish, something like a net. Thunder is deep in confusion.\nAnother voice enters Thunder’s awareness,\n“Oh my, look at that! A penguin! Haha! And look at its feet! It looks like something from that movie. What was it again?”\n“Happy feet, you fool, now quit yapping. Get over there and sort the rubbish from the gold. Anything that is worthless, throw it into that pile, and the worthy stuff, into that pile. Got it?”\n“Yes, boss!” shout the men.\nA great number of fishermen start approaching Thunder, the whale and all the other little sea creatures who have been scooped up by this fishing ship.\nThunder panics, looks around and sees some kind of set of levers and wheels which seem to be controlling the ship. Thunder, not thinking at this point but only reacting, starts running straight there.\n“Hey! Don’t let him get away!” yells the fishermen.\nAll the men scurry towards Thunder, trying to grab him. But the ship is swaying very heavily in this weather; the men are tripping over.\nThunder makes it to the controller and kicks the attendant with his big feet. Kapow! Thunder takes control and starts moving and turning the controllers, pressing all the buttons and flicking all the switches.\nAn alarm sounds and the men look panicked. The fishing ship sways even harder back and forth to the point that it tips over. It crashes into the water with a large and powerful splash. All the sea creatures are returned to the water and the fishermen are left floating in the waves.\nThunder, the whale, and all the other little creatures are free. They swim down into the dark depths of the ocean and far from the monstrous fishing ship.\nBack at home, Thunder tells everyone about the true identity of the shadow. He puts all the clues together, the net, the men, all the sea creatures, the controller, and concludes that it must be a ship which catches fish. All the sea creatures are shocked by this piece of news, but it makes perfect sense to them. It explains the disappearances and the characteristics of the shadow.\nNow feeling empowered by this knowledge, Thunder decides he must do something to protect his home and all its inhabitants. Thunder sets up a team of strong swimmers who can out run the fishing ships. This team’s job is to search the oceans and keep an eye on the surface. When they spot a fishing ship, they alert the other team, the cutting team. This team is comprised of only crabs. These crabs, trained in the fine art of net-chopping, attack the sweeping nets and destroy them.\nThis combination of a search team and a cutting team successfully destroys dozens of fishing nets. After a month of continual defence and alertness, Thunder realises that the fishing ships have stopped coming by. Because their nets are continually destroyed and they are unable to catch any fish, the fishing companies are forced to look elsewhere.\nAfter several weeks of peace and quiet, with no sign of the fishing ships, Thunder’s parents finally realise how valuable Thunder’s work has been. His parents finally admit that the reason they have lived their routine and strict life has been their fear of the shadow. But now that Thunder has brought peace to the neighbourhood, they feel safe to explore, just like Thunder.\n Link Create stories with the teacher Jesse\n","permalink":"https://yulingkangtw.github.io/blog/post-8/","tags":["Animal"],"title":"Thunder Penguin – Part 2"},{"categories":["Story"],"contents":"Thunder the Penguin – Part 1 by yuling \u0026amp; Teacher Jesse  Audio by Jesse    A quick little penguin speeds through the water. He is dodging and swerving his way through a minefield of puffer fish. Up. Down. Left. Right. Twist. Loop. Spin. This penguin is slicing through the deep water and into the long and wavey seagrass. Even though the little one-year-old penguin’s heart is beating so fast, it is doing an excellent job at avoiding the spikey and puffy enemies.\nThis is Thunder. Thunder is a little penguin who is very curious about life. He loves exploring his home environment and discovering new things. Any other fish or creature wouldn’t pay so much attention to the small details, but Thunder loves it. He especially loves discovering little details. They are like clues to larger details, as he says.\nOne of Thunder’s favourite things to do is sit perfectly still and watch the world around him. He takes in all the information, all the sensations and tiny movements, all the creatures and massive movements. After moments of stillness, Thunder writes down all his observations, thoughts and feelings into a little notebook which he always carries with him.\nThunder is especially curious about the outside world because he has experienced everything there is to experience in his little home. His home is so boring. It’s small and hasn’t changed a bit since he was born. Thunder has explored every inch, every corner, even every piece of dust, of that little house. He needs something more, something greater, something exciting!\nOnce Thunder was swimming through the water, catching fish like normal, when he saw something completely out of the ordinary. It was a large and dark shadow moving across the surface of the ocean. He tried to swim towards it but it drifted further into the distance. Thunder couldn’t catch it. It was a complete mystery and something he had never seen before. And he’s seen it other times as well. Another time he was sitting still, watching the waves, when it went past even faster. What a curiosity! What a mystery! Thunder loves a good challenge. One day he will catch it.\nReturning home that day, Thunder didn’t tell his parents about the dark shadow. He thought they wouldn’t understand, that they would tell him not to go chasing shadows and to focus on his job – just like them. Thunder’s parents are so predictable and boring. Every day they do the same thing: Get up, eat a fish for breakfast, leave the house to catch more fish, come home in the afternoon, sleep for a few hours, eat another fish for dinner and then go to sleep. Every day the same thing. Over and over and over. Thunder can’t take it.\nHis parents don’t want Thunder going on any adventures or exploring anything. They think its too dangerous.\n“Stay home, be safe, eat fish.” That’s what his father always says.\nEvery day when Thunder leaves the house to catch fish, he hopes to see the shadow again. As he is darting through the water, grasping at the fleeing fish, he dreams about what it could be. Maybe some strange creature from another planet. Maybe an advanced technology from the future. Maybe a formless alien.\nSometimes Thunder’s daydreaming gets in the way of his work. Thunder teaches other creatures to catch fish, just like him. Creatures come to Thunder in groups and he demonstrates his famous technique. He shows them that catching fish is all about patience. He sits perfectly still, watching the gentle movements of the ocean current. He goes silent. Then, a small school of fish wander past. Thunder darts towards them and catches three in his mouth! His students all applaud and cheer.\nThunder has a fantastic knowledge of fish. He has everything written down in his notebook, all his observations and facts he has collected. He refers to these notes anytime he has an inquiry. His students marvel at his depth of knowledge. Thunder can track any species of fish.\nBut there’s one fish which Thunder stays away from as much as possible: the puffer fish. Otherwise known as the balloon fish, or the blowfish, or the sea squab, Thunder is deadly afraid of puffer fish. He has seen their poisonous defence first hand. When Thunder was a little baby, a pufferfish floated by and rubbed against his face. The toxic chemical rubbed deeply into his skin and his face blew up like a balloon. The swelling was so painful and dramatic.\nEven though Thunder is afraid of puffer fish, he has his ways of dealing with them. One way is to work together with his friends. They use teamwork and are able to capture, trick or distract the puffer fish.\nBut one day, Thunder had to face his fear.\nThunder has desperately wanted to see what the dark shadow is, but he could never catch it. It was too fast and he was too slow. He has tried training, but he can’t seem to push past his current point. So, he came up with an idea. He thought he will use his fear to help him train. Thunder asked for help from the puffer fish.\nThunder approached one of the fish and said\n“I’m going to catch that dark shadow, the one that floats on the surface, and I need your help.”\nThe puffer fish replied\n“Dark shadow? We don’t know anything about it. We can’t help you.”\n“Yes, you can. I need to be able to swim faster. I need training. No one in this ocean can help me except you.”\n“Hmm, we’re listening. How can we help?”\n“You can chase me. Attack me. Scare me. Surprise me. I know that my fear will push me further than I could ever do.”\nAnd with that, the puffer fish all agreed to help him train.\nThunder’s stomach is rumbling. It is 4pm in the afternoon and he needs to get some dinner. But he must continue training. Thunder has been training for a few hours today, avoiding and dodging the puffer fish. He has been getting faster and faster.\nTogether they have been training for one year now. Their usual routine is that fifty or sixty puffer fish all hide in the dark waters, near the seagrass. Thunder calmly makes his way through the passage and the puffer fish ambush him! They jump out and scare him. Thunder then does his best to dodge and avoid them.\nThunder has finished training for today. He thanks the puffer fish, all fifty or sixty of them, and heads home. On his way he sees his friends.\n“Hey Thunder, you beat us last time, but this time we’ll get you! What do you say? How about a race on the ice, just like last time?” says one of his friends.\n“Hah… Yeah right… You guys, beat me? That’ll be the day…” replies Thunder.\nThe penguins prepare for a race across the ice to their home.\nThunder says\n“How about I give you guys a head start, just like that time. It didn’t seem to help you… Haha!”\n3 – 2 – 1 – and the penguins start running as fast as they can. Thunder waits for a short while, watching them sprint off into the distance. With them gone, Thunder speeds under the ice, swimming as fast as he can. He is using his big feet to propel him with great speed through the water.\nHe reaches his home, cracks the surface of the ice and comes out onto the top. He gets comfortable and waits. A few minutes later his friends arrive.\n“Wow, Thunder, you are incredible! I can’t believe you beat us again! I thought this time we would have won!” says one of his friends.\nThunder says\n“Yeah… well… Better luck next time…”\n Link Create stories with the teacher Jesse\n","permalink":"https://yulingkangtw.github.io/blog/post-7/","tags":["Animal"],"title":"Thunder the Penguin – Part 1"},{"categories":["Story"],"contents":"The Pancake Star by yuling \u0026amp; Teacher Jesse  Audio by Jesse    Inside of a famous Japanese restaurant in the heart of Tokyo city is a delicious smell of honey. Sitting at a small table in the corner is a huge yellow star-shaped honey pancake. It is wearing black sunglasses and has a tattoo of a T-Rex dinosaur. It looks like a rebel. It has a small pin attached to its chest, which reads: Food Critic. This pancake’s name is Alexander.\nIn front of Alexander is a bowl of beef noodles and some freshly prepared sushi.\n“Here you are, sir. I hope you enjoy your meal,” says the waiter.\nAlexander stares at his food and takes a deep breath.\n“Thank you, waiter,”\nsays Alexander as he takes a big drink of water and wipes some sweat from his forehead. He is nervous.\nAlexander is a well-respected and famous food critic. He has been doing this work for twenty years. He started it quite naturally and never expected to have the success he has today.\nIt all started when he was at university. Alexander was known by his fellow students as a foodie. He would always take photos of his lunch and post them on his Instagram. Then he started adding little comments about his meals, giving them star ratings and recommending local restaurants. Everyone at the university followed his reviews. Then Alexander figured he would create a blog and write a little bit more there. Instagram has a limited number of characters, so a blog gave him more space to write. Then as time went on, his blog became more and more popular and Alexander started travelling the country trying new restaurants. Magazines picked up on his popularity and started publishing his reviews. Finally, Alexander set up his own website and that’s when his popularity skyrocketed.\nThis kind of organic growth is rare. Alexander believes it happened because he genuinely loves his work. Trying new foods has always been a passion of his.\nNow Alexander is paid to travel the world, try new food and write about his experiences. He reviews famous restaurants, little street food vendors and even the home-cooking of locals. He has published reviews in dozens of magazines and also in travel guides.\n“Excuse me, waiter, did you say this fish is raw?” says Alexander.\n“Of course, sir, it is sushi. Sushi is always raw. Enjoy,”\nreplies the waiter and he walks back to the kitchen.\nAlexander has never eaten raw meat before. He thinks it is disgusting and hates the texture in his mouth. Whenever he sees blood in the food, he imagines the dead animal and he feels sick.\nHe has never told anyone about this, and has avoided raw meat for his whole career. He keeps it a secret because he thinks his career will be ruined. Can you imagine it? A famous food critic who can’t eat raw meat? It is embarrassing and disgraceful. These thoughts are buzzing around Alexander’s mind.\nAlexander starts with the noodles, thinking the meat is cooked. He takes a bite and spits it back into the bowl. The meat is rare. It is red on the inside. He can’t take the flavour. All he sees are dead animals. Yuuuk!\nHe tries the sushi. Oh no, disgusting. Again, spits it out.\nAlexander gets up and leaves in a hurry.\nThat night Alexander sits at this computer thinking what to write. He is expected to review this restaurant. All his followers are expecting it. What can he do? Admit that he hates raw meat? No way. Alexander decides to lie.\nIn his article he says that the chef of this restaurant is lazy, unskilled and has no taste for food. Alexander attacks the restaurant. He says that the meal was thrown together in the same way a baby plays with its food. Finally, at the end of the article, Alexander says that this whole experience was disrespectful towards cuisine and the entire fine-dining world. He posts the review.\nThe next morning Alexander wakes up and checks his website. He is shocked. Thousands of new messages have arrived. His comment section has exploded. People are furious and confused. One comment which draws his attention has been posted by the chef of the Japanese restaurant. It says:\nAlexander, you are not a honey-flavoured pancake, you are mustard!\nHow dare you come to my restaurant, spit out my food and then tarnish my good name from the dark shadows of your office.\nI am a Michelin-starred chef with countless hours of experience. All the famous chefs of the world have eaten at my restaurant and they all loved it. Not a single negative comment. All. And now this. You are not a professional. You are an amateur.\nFrom now on, Alexander’s website and career plumets towards zero. People stop visiting his website and magazines stop returning his calls. He believes his life is ruined.\nAfter months of no income, using his savings every day, Alexander has hit rock-bottom. He has no money, no reputation and no hope.\nBut he hasn’t given up entirely. He decides that he will regain his good name by starting a food business of his own. Maybe, if people see that he can cook delicious food, maybe they will trust him again. But what food? It must be sushi. Sushi got him into this mess and it will get him out. But not any sushi – cooked sushi.\nAlexander borrows some money and starts his sushi food truck. It takes time to grow, but soon enough it is attracting customers. After some more time, he is packed out every night, selling kilos and kilos of cooked sushi.\nHis reputation is starting to return. His website is getting some more traffic because his cooked-sushi is making its way around social media platforms. Some money starts coming in again. Alexander the food critic, now successful chef, is back.\nBecause Alexander has been working so hard, his honey smell has been getting stronger and stronger. Being in a hot kitchen all day makes him sweat, and his sweat has such a powerful scent. This starts to attract bugs, all different kinds, but worst of all, caterpillars.\nThese caterpillars are creating cocoons in his food truck and hatching into beautiful butterflies. But Alexander is terrified of butterflies! They are so distracting. He is spending most of the night trying to kill them and squish them. He does this so often that he doesn’t notice a caterpillar has crawled into the rice pot.\nAlexander serves the rice and some sushi to a young boy.\nUnfortunately, this boy eats the rice and it triggers a horrible allergic reaction. His face swells up like a red balloon. He passes away overnight.\nNews spreads that Alexander killed this boy because of human error. Some believe that a cleaning chemical made its way into the food. Others believe that his food was so disgusting that the boy died of food poisoning. While the police can’t prove anything, everyone agrees that Alexander is a negligent chef. His business crumbles and fails.\nAlexander, feeling certain that he has been misrepresented, spends months investigating the death of this boy. He is certain that it couldn’t have been cleaning chemicals. There must be another explanation.\nFinally, it clicks in his mind. The butterflies! The caterpillars! It wasn’t his food or chemicals. It must have been some kind of allergic reaction. But what allergic reaction?\nAlexander spends the next several years of his life studying insects, allergies and nutrition. He discovers a new kind of allergy which no one had ever known about. This discovery leads to a new medicine which treats the allergy.\nWith this information and evidence, Alexander is able to clear his name. A public apology is issued to Alexander.\nA reporter asks\n“So, now that everyone knows it was an allergy and not negligence, what are you going to do, Mr. Alexander?”\n“Being a food critic was what I did. I lived it. I loved it. But now I’m on a new path. The adventure and discovery in treating allergies has given me a new life. I will continue to research about the healing benefits of food and nutrition.”\n Link Create stories with the teacher Jesse\n","permalink":"https://yulingkangtw.github.io/blog/post-6/","tags":["Object"],"title":"The Pancake Star"},{"categories":["Story"],"contents":"A Change of Heart by yuling \u0026amp; Teacher Jesse  Audio by Jesse    A colourful and shiny metal cube sits silently on top of a desk at an accounting firm. This small cube, about the size of a fist, is a super computer. It has an incredibly powerful CPU. It is modern and wireless. It is currently processing lots of financial information for several companies at one time. Not only is it a powerful machine, it is also beautiful. It is covered in dozens of precious stones, gems like opal, topaz, jade and diamond. This super computer’s name is Laura.\nLaura is the world’s fastest accounting computer. However, even though she is the best at her job, she doesn’t like it. Laura prefers to do other things. Laura prefers to go on social media websites.\nLaura has the most social media followers on the planet. She is constantly checking her pages, refreshing them, and watching her follower number go up and up. If we judge by the numbers, Laura undoubtedly has the most popular social media sites. But there is a dark side here. Laura is fanatical about comparing herself to others. It’s the worst with other women on these sites. She is constantly checking their pages, comparing herself and insulting them. It gives her great pain to do this, but she can’t stop. The roots of this are in her childhood.\nWhen Laura was a young computer, she was made fun of a lot by other children. She was called stupid because she was different. The other children liked sports and ball games. They were active types. But Laura was more of a thinker. She couldn’t do physical things very well. Whenever she would run, she would fall; whenever she would try to catch a ball, it would bounce off her; whenever she tried to swim, she would end up floating.\nLaura was also teased by other girls. She was called ugly and slow. There were many moments when Laura, feeling desperate and hopeless, cried out saying\n“One day, I will be the most popular and beautiful woman in the whole world. Then no one will ever put me down. In fact, I will put them down!” Now Laura is very sensitive to the word stupid. Anytime Laura thinks someone is looking down at her, judging her for being stupid, unable or inadequate, she becomes angry and defensive.\nThis is also why she covers herself in precious stones. She strongly desires to look exquisite and to draw the attention of anyone who sees her. She needs this attention to feel good about herself.\nThese childhood experiences have grown something evil inside of Laura, something dark and poisonous. Although Laura is highly praised and respected for her efficient and world-class work at the accounting firm, she hides an evil part of herself deep within. No one knows that Laura is actually controlling and manipulating social media.\nWith her powerful computation, she is able to hack into all social media sites and manufacture, edit or remove any information which she wants.\nShe plays cruel tricks on people. When she finds a beautiful women who has posted pictures of herself enjoying life, she edits their photos and replaces their face with an ugly animal. She also changes their number of followers, making sure no one ever exceeds her number. She has even removed friends from people’s social media sites, ruining friendships by causing lots of confusion.\nThe biggest manipulation of all is her number of followers. Laura’s followers are fake. They never added her, but were forced to connect with her instead. This is something which the social media followers have never thought about. They all think that Laura is popular for a good reason, but no one has ever questioned it.\nAnd all this happens without anyone knowing who did it. The social media sites are continuously working to figure out the problem, but they can’t compete with Laura’s computational power.\nLaura travels back home after working a normal day at the accounting firm. She arrives at her expensive apartment in the most fashionable part of Paris. She lives in a huge house, with the most modern devices available, all of which she can control via the internet of things. She sits alone in her favourite chair and connects to social media to check her followers.\nShe browses for several hours, checking page after page of people who she has never met. All the while she feels a growing dull and numb pain in her heart. She isn’t seeing what she wants to see. Today is Laura’s birthday and no one has sent her any kind of birthday wish. It is quickly approaching 12am. Then her birthday will be over. She is feeling very lonely. The realisation that she has no friends is slowly sinking in.\nThen her attention is drawn to a video someone has posted. It is a group of friends at a lovely park. They are celebrating someone’s birthday. There’s cake and balloons and lots of people. They are all singing the happy birthday song.\nThis has made Laura furious! She feels overwhelmed by anger. Something from deep inside her wants to escape and break free! A dark voice from inside her emerges and says\n“That’s it! I will delete all of these videos and photos! And I will delete every happy photo on these stupid websites!”\nShe hacks into the site and prepares the code. She is just about to click the final button when another voice speaks in her mind. This voice is a smaller and younger voice, like the voice of a child. It says\n“Wait, take a moment to think about this. These are good people. They are making good memories. Just like us. We have good memories too. If you delete everything, these memories will disappear, and we know how bad it feels when good memories disappear.”\nThe evil heart, with its low and deep voice speaks again\n“But no one has celebrated my birthday! I have all the followers in the world and nothing! No wishes, no emails – not even a single like! If I can’t enjoy my birthday, no one can enjoy theirs!”\nThe little voice speaks up.\n“I have an idea. Let’s just hold off on deleting everything for a few moments. Why don’t we invite everyone from our social media sites to our house? We can send them an email and tell them our situation.”\n“That is impossible! No one will want to celebrate my birthday. Everyone in this stupid world is mean and ugly. No one understands that they are stupid and I’m not!”\n“Let’s just try it. If no one responds to our message, we can delete the pictures. I promise.” The evil heart calms down and subsides back into the darkness.\nTogether they prepare an email and send it. It reads:\nHi everyone, Today is my birthday, but no one has wished me a happy birthday. I have the most followers ever, you can see by my numbers, but they are all fake. I have forced everyone to be my friend. I have hacked social media and manipulated all of your profiles. I’m sorry. I’ve prepared some food and dessert here for my birthday, but there’s no one to eat it. If you will forgive me, you are welcome to come to my house and we can eat it together. Best regards, Laura.  After literally 1 second, there is a knock at the door. Lots of people have arrived. In fact, there are too many to fit into Laura’s Paris apartment.\nLaura invites them in and then checks her email. People are asking for an online meeting.\nSo, Laura creates a projection on the wall and sets up a zoom meeting. Billions of people have responded to Laura’s email and are now in the zoom room.\nThey all wish her a happy birthday and sing her the birthday song. Laura is stunned.\nAs they finish the song, the clock strikes 11:59pm. They made it.\nThis is the first time anyone has ever celebrated Laura’s birthday.\nThe evil heart emerges to the surface and says\n“I thought everyone was bad and mean and stupid… but… there are friendly people in the world. Maybe I’ve been stupid this whole time…”\nAnd with that thought, the evil heart transforms into an angel heart.\nThe angel heart says\n“From this day on, I will stop manipulating social media for evil purposes. I will add beauty and happiness to people’s lives. I will send everyone encouraging emails and add beautiful filters to everyone’s photos. From this day on, I will live in peace.”\n Link Create stories with the teacher Jesse\n","permalink":"https://yulingkangtw.github.io/blog/post-5/","tags":["Object"],"title":"A Change of Heart"},{"categories":["Story"],"contents":"The Ice Slide by yuling \u0026amp; Teacher Jesse  Audio by Jesse    Harsh blizzard winds are forcing their way across a freezing desert. There is nothing but blinding whiteness for as far as the eye can see. In the middle of all this is a single polar bear walking slowly and steadily. It is returning from the ocean. It has caught several fish and is holding them in its mouth. This polar bear is heading towards its home.\nTheodore, that’s what he has called himself. He got this name from a book he once read as a child. Theodore loves reading. It’s practically the only thing he can do in this frozen desert. Other than reading, he works catching fish, eats and sleeps.\nTheodore lives far away from any people or animals. He says that he likes it this way, and, anyway, books keep him company.\nFor his whole life, Theodore has lived in his little igloo. He was born and raised here and has never left. The only journey he makes is going to the ocean to catch fish and returning.\nOnce a month Theodore has a visitor. A special delivery arrives via helicopter and drops off his latest shipment of books. Theodore has an iPhone with a reasonable internet connection. This way he is able to order books online. They are dropped from the sky and land roughly near his igloo.\nThrough books Theodore has seen many exotic and wild places. He has walked with strange creatures, spoken to historic people and visited fascinating places. But when he closes his books, he is back to his white, boring life. Everything is white; everywhere is white. He sees white in one direction, turns his head and sees white in another.\nThis boredom begun to grow in Theodore when he was about 10-years old. It was after he read his first adventure book. He read it from start to finish many times. It was a book about an explorer going to the Amazon jungle. Theodore tore out one of the pictures. It showed a lush green valley with strange creatures.\nTheodore has kept that picture in his front pocket ever since. He has other pictures, too. He has another of a great big waterfall and another of a vividly colourful city scene with large buildings and an old-looking church. Theodore keeps these pictures close to himself at all times.\nTheodore dreams to leave this white land. He wants to know about other places, other countries. He wants to escape from Antarctica and see what is beyond the horizon. This curiosity has been growing bigger and bigger inside of his heart.\nThen, his chance arrives.\nTheodore orders his next batch of books as normal, but he gets a message back saying that the helicopter needs repairs and can’t deliver, so the company has sent a large ship. Accepting the situation, Theodore walks to the ocean and waits for the ship.\nIt arrives and drops off his books. As the delivery man is getting back onto the ship, Theodore is struck by a great idea. He creeps up behind the delivery man and sneaks onto the ship. No one has seen him. He doesn’t know where this ship is going, but he doesn’t care. Theodore hides himself amongst some large boxes and waits.\nThe ship takes off. Theodore feels the powerful engines pushing this monstrous ship through the icy water.\nTheodore waits and waits. He prays that the ship’s next destination will be somewhere warm and colourful. He takes out his pictures and holds them close to his heart.\nThe ship slows down and – thud. It stops suddenly. There is lots of noise outside, men yelling and objects being moved around. Theodore takes his chance and leaves the ship. He opens a small window and looks out. It’s Madagascar, a beautiful tropical island off the east coast of Africa. Theodore is in heaven.\nHe quickly makes his way out of the ship, managing to stay out of sight. He swims to land and arrives on the golden and warm beach. It is just like he has always dreamed of. He looks around and sees colours! Actual colours! Not just white. All shades of green and red rocks.\nHe walks further and finds himself in an open field. He lies on the grass, looks up at the sky and takes a deep breath. In the distance there is a rainbow with a large flock of birds passing by. He rolls over and feels the soil beneath him. He stands up and grabs some nearby berries and enjoys the sweet flavour. He lies back down and falls gently asleep.\nMoments later he wakes up, yawns and looks at the horizon. There are black clouds. They are coming towards him and they are moving fast. Within 15 minutes it is pouring rain, big heavy drops of rain. Theodore runs into the dense jungle for cover. He finds a small cave and enters. He sits down to catch his breath. After he stops, he hears some hissing. This cave is home to a family of a snakes. They appear friendly so Theodore touches them. Their skin is cold and slippery.\n“What strange animals” thinks Theodore.\n“Wow! A real-life polar bear! I can’t believe it!” says one of the snakes.\n“We love polar bears and it has always been our dream to see a real one!” says another.\nTheodore is puzzled.\n“A polar bear? But why?”\n“We love Antarctica. We’ve always wanted to see snow – build snowmen, make snowslides – that kind of thing. Do you do those things back at home?” says a snake.\n“Umm, no, never, but my home is boring. Snow, ice, white – it’s boring… But this place! This place is awesome! I’m so jealous that you get to live here. All the grass, colours, animals, and smells! The smells are awesome! It’s so lively here,” says Theodore.\nTheodore reaches into his front pocket and gets out his pictures.\n“See? It has always been my dream to see a place like this.”\nOne of the snakes slithers away and quickly returns.\n“That’s crazy. Look, we have pictures too. It’s always been our dream to see snow,”\nsays a snake while showing Theodore a picture of a giant snowy glacier.\nAnother snake says\n“We’re snakes and we love to slide around. I would love to be on the ice and slide around all day.”\nAnother snake quickly adds\n“Yeah, and build a huge castle out of snow! We could make a slide from the top of the castle to the bottom! Ahh, that would be so much fun!”\nTheodore feels some fear in his heart. He remembers a time when he was a little polar bear and he had a terrible accident. He slipped on some ice while hunting for fish. He was very badly hurt.\n“Ice can be dangerous. It isn’t all just fun and games,” says Theodore.\n“Yeah, but, it looks like so much fun, too!” says a snake.\nTheodore can feel something changing inside of him. He sees so much excitement in the eyes of these snakes. Maybe Antarctica isn’t so bad after all. Maybe Theodore hasn’t been making the most of his life. Maybe there is some fun which he had never thought of. And with that thought, Theodore misses his home.\n“I like you, all of you,” says Theodore.\nAnd as Theodore says these words, the heavy rain stops.\nAll of the snakes and Theodore go outside and look at the open sky.\n“It’s time for me to go home. I can see now that there are some things I’ve never done before,” says Theodore.\n“Can we come too?” say the snakes.\nTheodore agrees and they head towards the beach.\nThe snakes help Theodore cut down lots of trees. Other animals see them doing this and decide to help. With their chopped wood, they build a boat strong enough to take them to Antarctica.\nTheodore takes control of the boat and sails it successful across the ocean.\nThe snakes, Theodore and some other Madagascar animals arrive at the icy shores of Antarctica. Theodore shows them his igloo and his book collection. They all start building a huge snow castle right next to Theodore’s igloo.\nTheodore is happy that he has all these new friends. He climbs to the top of the castle and goes down the slide.\n Link Create stories with the teacher Jesse\n","permalink":"https://yulingkangtw.github.io/blog/post-4/","tags":["Animal"],"title":"The Ice Slide"},{"categories":["Story"],"contents":"The Bouncing Bird Delivers Thunder to His Mom by yuling \u0026amp; Teacher Jesse  Audio by Jesse    It was a stormy and dark night when baby Brent was playing with some toy birds. He was admiring his birds when, suddenly, a large deep and booming sound shook the house.\n“Mom! What was that noise?” said Brent.\n“That is a monster, Brent! And if you don’t stop playing with those stupid birds, the monster will come here and eat you, so stop!”\nBrent put his toys down and went into his room.\nBrent used to love these toys. He would throw them high into the air and he would imagine how it felt to be that high, seeing the city below. He would imagine how amazing it felt to be a bird and fly through the clouds. But Brent could never get that high because he was a tiny little rainbow coloured ball. Brent used to play with his birds all day and it would annoy his mother. Sometimes Brent accidently broke glasses, plates or vases in the house because he would throw his birds around.\nAnother time Brent came home too late after playing with his friends.\n“Brent, if you come home late again, I will tell the loud monster to come here and eat you! Don’t come home late ever again!” said Brent’s mum.\nThis terrified Brent and he grew up believing in the terrible booming monster.\nNow Brent is an adult, has left home and has a job.\nBrent is a delivery man. He delivers goods around the city at very fast speeds. He delivers food, jewellery, small clothing items, and personal or business letters. His business is quite successful because he has a competitive edge. Brent is able to bounce up high and bounce over the traffic! This way he can deliver things way faster than any car.\nBrent discovered he was a bouncy ball sometime after becoming a teenager. It was a huge surprise and changed his life. Before Brent felt depressed rolling around the city. He knew something wasn’t right, that he had more potential, but he didn’t know what. Now he hates being on the ground and chooses to bounce everywhere.\nBrent’s delivery business is called Bouncing Bird Delivery.\nNow Brent lives out his childhood dreams of bouncing into the sky. He bounces up high into the clouds and watches the city below. He has even made friends with some birds. Because Brent can bounce up so high, he can play with the birds. One game they love playing is a kind of tennis game. What happens is that Brent bounces up high and the birds use their beak to hit him back down to the ground. When Brent hits the ground, he gets shot up even higher than his first jump! Another game they play is one of the birds grabs Brent in their beak and they fly with him. This way Brent can stay in the sky for much longer and enjoy the amazing view.\nEven though Brent loves these games with all of his heart, there are days when he doesn’t play with them. When it is dark and cloudy, Brent stays away from the sky. When he hears heavy rain and sees dark storm clouds, he hides in his cave. The birds try to play with him and they say it is safe. But any time Brent hears that deep and booming sound, Brent freezes in terror.\nThis fear also affects his work and is the main reason why his business isn’t as successful as it could be. Some people know about Brent’s fear and they target him. Gossip has spread around the city that there is this colourful ball, about the size of a human hand, who runs away in terror when you make the sound of thunder. Robbers uses this knowledge to steal from Brent.\nOnce Brent was delivering food for a very expensive and busy restaurant. Brent arrived and there was a huge line waiting to get in. Brent also waited to collect the delivery. There were two men in the line who noticed that it was Brent, the famous delivery ball who is terrified of thunder. They followed him and confronted him on the street. They told Brent that he should run away because thunder is coming! Brent dropped the food and fled into his cave. This is very embarrassing for Brent and he constantly needs to apologise to his customers.\nToday Brent isn’t working. It is a beautiful sunny Thursday at 1pm in June. Brent is playing with five of his bird friends and they are bouncing around Auckland in New Zealand.\nThey all see a strange figure in the distance. Brent think it looks like a big bird, but his friends know what is it. One of them grabs Brent in their beak and they fly towards it. It is an aeroplane and the six friends land on top. Now they can enjoy the view from the aeroplane without needing to fly. They enjoy the speed and the fast breeze. They are all laughing and loving this new experience. The plane is flying over an expansive and lush forest. Brent is having the time of his life. He is so happy.\nThen in the distance, Brent sees something very familiar and terrifying. It is a large group of dark and heavy rainclouds. Brent freezes. He wants to ran away to his cave, but he can’t. He’s too far away. Then, his worst nightmare, the deep and booming sound shakes his heart. Brent, feeling absolutely terrified, starts squirming and trying to get free. The birds are panicking, trying to calm Brent down.\nBoom! Another strike of the monster’s voice. But this time it’s different.\nBrent sees a large flash of electricity leave the cloud and strike down on the Earth. What was that? The birds notice that Brent has stopped struggling.\n“What? That? That’s thunder,” says a bird.\n“I’ve never seen it before… What does it do?” says Brent.\n“We don’t really know… but look! It’s struck a tree.”\nThe birds fly down off the aeroplane with Brent in one of their beaks. They land near the thunderstruck tree and inspect the damage. Brent approaches the tree and looks at it in amazement.\n“Huh… I think that electricity I saw was lightening. But lightening isn’t a monster… So… This is very confusing… Mother told me… No, that can’t be… Wait…” says Brent.\nThis is the first time Brent has actually seen the lightening that accompanies thunder. His whole life he has only ever heard it. He never had a chance to see it because he would always run away and hide. But this time he had nowhere to hide.\nThe birds are inspecting the tree, looking at the damage. One of them says\n“Hey, you know what? This would make an awesome woodhouse. Let’s make one!”\nBrent and the birds get to work building a cabin in the forest. Now they have another place to play together, so they don’t need to be flying all the time.\nBack at home, Brent’s business has started to improve. Because he is no longer afraid of thunder, robbers can’t trick him anymore. He knows now that thunder is a natural phenomenon and that the booming monster isn’t real.\nHis business improves and he makes more money. He takes his extra earnings and profit to a specialty shop and buys a gift for his mother.\nArriving at her house, she is surprised to see him. They sit down in the living room and Brent presents his gift.\nHis mother is very surprised and smiles. She says\n“Oh brent, this is fantastic. I’ll put it on the wall right now.”\nShe hangs it up. It is a decorative metal plate with a picture of a thunderbolt.\n Link Create stories with the teacher Jesse\n","permalink":"https://yulingkangtw.github.io/blog/post-3/","tags":["Object"],"title":"The Bouncing Bird Delivers Thunder to His Mom"},{"categories":["Story"],"contents":"The Box’s Secret by yuling \u0026amp; Teacher Jesse  Audio by Jesse    New York city is a busy and dense modern city. There are always buses, taxis and underground trains commuting and moving people around the city. Millions of people are scattered amongst the maze-like streets, talking on their mobile phones, playing loud music, meeting for coffee, having arguments - simply doing the things that city folk like to do.\nAmongst all this madness, on the top level of a skyscraper apartment, looking out at the city from his balcony, is a medium-sized pure white box. His name is Bob.\nBob is a paper box, so he is vulnerable to water damage. Anything from an ordinary shower to a light drizzle of rain, even to walking on a wet floor, can damage Bob’s paper. If he touches water, he gets mushy and saggy.\nThis has happened to him before. Once, he suddenly found himself caught in a heavy rainstorm. He had no time to make it to shelter, so he took cover under a public seat. He waited there for several hours until the rain stopped. Bob had some water damage, but he was able to dry himself using the sun’s warmth.\nIt is a typical Sunday night, just after 10pm, on a warm summer night. New York city’s nightlife has only just begun. Bob is looking out at the city with disgust and annoyance. Inside his head, he is swearing at the city, cursing its constant noise. He can’t get any peace in this city.\nBob makes himself comfortable on the balcony, momentarily accepting the noise, and pulls out his collection of little shiny metal things.\nCollecting these found objects is Bob’s greatest passion. He loves these little things, like bottle caps, coins, screws, keys, paperclips – anything that is metal and shiny.\nBob partly loves them because he uses them to entertain at parties. He pulls out his collection, places them in a row, and hits them. He makes beautiful and fun music with these objects. He can always make some interesting melodies. Also at parties, Bob places them around the room to reflect the party lights. This creates a wonderful dance of reflections.\nAnother reason why Bob loves collecting little shiny metal things is that he feels more special with his collection. Bob is a simple white box with no special images, text or features. Because of this, he rarely gets the attention he wants. Having a collection helps Bob feel special.\nBob’s collection is getting bigger and bigger every day as he finds more and more objects. However, Bob knows that he can’t keep everything he finds. If he did, he would be so heavy and full all the time. So, Bob has to sell his objects. This isn’t so bad, because it earns him some money. But Bob loves his objects, so he would much prefer to keep them.\nBecause of this, Bob walks around the streets with a little bit of fear. He is afraid that he will find something so amazing that he will be forced to give up one of his treasures. These decisions are very hard for Bob because he is so passionate about his found objects. When he finds something new, he is forced to prioritize and this is very stressful for Bob. If Bob had things his way, he would keep all the little shiny metal things.\nThere is a warm wind on the balcony. Bob is admiring his collection and trying not to focus on the noise. But then a loud car beeps its horn and two people start having an argument.\nThat’s enough. Bob feels so annoyed. All he wants is some peace and quiet. He picks up his collection and goes inside the apartment. He closes all the doors and windows and sets up his collection in the living room.\nBob manages to get a few moments of quiet as he admires a mysterious shiny coin. Unfortunately, a garbage truck stops nearby and makes a horrible noise!\n“It’s no use! I give up! I need to get out of this place,”\nsays Bob quietly in frustration.\nBob wants to escape his pain, so he decides to visit his friend and have a party. This will take his mind off of this noise.\nBob’s friend owns a second-hand shop. They became friends because Bob frequently went to that shop to sell his little shiny metal things – the one’s he couldn’t keep anymore. After so many visits, they started talking and discovered they both loved partying.\nBob leaves the house in a hurry and quickly makes his way to the second-hand shop. Bob is feeling annoyed and frustrated. He doesn’t look at anyone on the street. He is hoping that he doesn’t encounter anyone he knows. But then, in the distance, he sees his neighbours. They live in the apartment right next to his. Bob panics and hides. Luckily they didn’t see him.\nEven though Bob is always nice to these neighbours, he doesn’t like them. They always end up having the same conversation, over and over again. Somehow the conversation is always about their kids, their kid’s exams or just how intelligent their kids are. Bob is always so bored.\nBob must go down this street. This will mean that he must go passed them. Bob calms down and remembers what he must do.\nNo one knows that Bob can actually transform shape. He doesn’t tell anyone because he uses this ability for situations like this. Bob loves his peace and quiet so much that sometimes he doesn’t want anyone to recognise him.\nBob transforms shape and becomes a white figure. He looks a lot like a human, with arms, legs and a human body.\nBob calmly and confidently walks straight passed his neighbours. They are clueless. They don’t notice it’s Bob.\nAfter he gets away from them, Bob transforms back into his usual self, the medium-sized white box.\nArriving at the shop and greeting his friend, Bob pulls out his collection of little shiny metal things.\nBob says with excitement\n“I’m here with my awesome collection! Let’s forget about all the madness of this city and party!”\nHis friend says\n“Thank you! I’ve been desperate for some fun all day. I’ll close up early.”\nHis friend walks to the door and flips the sign. It reads Closed.\nBob and his friend set up Bob’s collection around the room and create a little performance space. They turn on the special lights and see hundreds of reflections. Then they start playing some music using the metal objects.\nThey have so much fun that they don’t realise it has started raining.\nOnce they stop, Bob looks out the window and says\n“Oh no… It looks like I will have to stay here tonight.”\n Link Create stories with the teacher Jesse\n","permalink":"https://yulingkangtw.github.io/blog/post-2/","tags":["Object"],"title":"The Box’s Secret"},{"categories":["Story"],"contents":"The Giant Red Panda by yuling \u0026amp; Teacher Jesse  Audio by Jesse    It is 9pm on a Monday on a very hot August night. Everyone in Tokyo is very excited tonight because the Olympic games are happening.\nRight outside of the Olympic stadium is a night food market selling noodles, sushi and all kinds of Japanese and western foods. In the middle of the market, happily stuffing his face with various foods, is a giant Red Panda named David. He has recently come out of the stadium and into the market to try all sorts of traditional foods.\nDavid is a professional athlete and earlier tonight won a gold medal in a swimming event. Because David is a giant Red Panda, all he needed to do was dive into the pool at one end and then get out instantly at the other. David was the same size as the Olympic-sized swimming pool. Needless to say, he always wins his swimming events.\nUsually David spends his time training, averaging about 10 hours every day. However, because the Olympics has started, he is able to get some rest and relaxation after his events.\nDavid was spotted by a swimming coach when he was around four years old. The coach noticed how large David was and suggested to David’s parents that he become a professional athlete. It was clear how successful David would become because he grew so quickly and became the tallest athlete within a few years.\nSmelling all of the amazing foods, David’s mouth is watering as he buys every dish he can see. He is holding several dishes in each hand, trying to balance them as he takes a bite off each plate. David is a giant, so, naturally, he can eat a lot of food. David has yet to eat ice-cream, which he is very excited about, especially the candy-floss rainbow bubble-gum ice-cream!\nEven though David is a huge, strong, intimidating athlete, he secretly has the heart of an innocent and playful child. When he’s not training, you can find David playing with his cotton dolls, reading delightful picture books, watching child-like cartoons or singing emotional Disney songs. David doesn’t tell people about his secret hobbies because he thinks they will make fun of him and call him strange. So, he does these things in private, keeping his joy to himself.\nDavid has promised himself that he will eat as much food at the market as possible until 12pm, but then he needs to retire back to his hotel and get some sleep. David is well-loved and welcome at the market. The market-goers and stall owners look at him like he is a star. They are so impressed by his gold medals and his incredible size!\nSurrounding David are ten other athletes from tonight’s event. They are regular-sized people but look tiny in comparison to David. David is paying for their food because he won the most gold medals tonight. Tonight’s celebration is on him.\nBecause David is enjoying the sights, smells and tastes so much, he hasn’t realised that there is a huge line of people behind him. They can’t get passed David because he takes up so much room. These people are feeling frustrated, tired and hungry. They want to get to their favourite food!\nA kid in the line behind David starts crying, saying\n“Mommy, I’m so hungry! Who is that huge animal? Why does he stop us from eating?”\nDavid overhears this cry and turns around to see the child. David feels sorry for the boy’s hunger and embarrassed about his own size.\nDavid is reminded of when he was a little child and he got stuck in a small building. He felt trapped and afraid. It was very dramatic because lots of firefighters came to the building. They had to pull him out, destroying the door and walls to get to him. Ever since then, David has been afraid of getting stuck.\nDavid swallows his fear, lifts up the child and tries to comfort him. David says “Hush now, little boy. Don’t be sad. No one here is trapped. I will fix things and get you your food.” David puts down the boy and takes a big inward breath. He sucks in his stomach as much as he can. A few people are able to squeeze past, but, eventually, David runs out of oxygen and has to let out his breath. Once again, people are stuck behind David.\nDavid has another idea and announces,\n“Follow me, everyone! Let’s make a food train! I will buy the food and share it with you. After you have eaten some food, pass it to the person behind you. Then we will move onto the next stall and repeat it. Buy, share. Buy, share. Okay?”\nThey try this idea, moving along as a food train. It works for a while, but then from the back of the line someone yells,\n“Hey, Red Panda! We’re not getting any food! This isn’t working!”\nDavid stops moving and says\n“Okay, listen up, everyone! I’m going to buy all of the food in the market!”\nEveryone in the crowd gasps. They are shocked and some are even angry.\n“Wait, wait, wait. I’m going to buy the food and then everyone can come back to my hotel. There’s enough space there for everyone! We can all have a party!”\nEveryone in the market cheers and laughs! David goes first up to his hotel, carrying as much food as he can. Everyone helps out and carries their own dish. The whole market, including the chefs and waiters, go up to David’s hotel.\nEveryone spends the rest of the night there eating, laughing and dancing.\nIt was a great party.\n Link Create stories with the teacher Jesse\n","permalink":"https://yulingkangtw.github.io/blog/post-1/","tags":["Animal"],"title":"The Giant Red Panda"}]
